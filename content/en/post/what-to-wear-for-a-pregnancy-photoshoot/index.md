## Bodysuit
_Perfect option_

{{< figure src="./pregnancy-photoshoot-1.jpg" title="Pregnancy photo shoot in Vogue style in Tallinn" >}}

Perfectly emphasizes the figure's lovely curves and lines. It can be used both on its alone and in tandem with other outfits. 

_YES:_ Solid black or nude/beige bodysuit (also ideal for shooting silhouettes if you don't want to be photographed in lingerie or nude).

Brightly colored or printed bodysuits also work well, however if you intend to use bright accents in your photos, please let me know in advance.

## Lingerie

{{< figure src="./pregnancy-photoshoot-2.jpg" title="Pregnancy photo shoot in Tallinn" >}}

Any underwear, whether casual, sporty, or elegant, is appropriate for images in lingerie. 

Consider smooth, seamless nude/beige underwear that are free of lace and appliqu√©s. 

You can wear an open shirt or jacket, open-toed shoes, and jeans or other clothes over the lingerie.

## Plain dress
_Emphasize the graceful lines of your figure_

{{< figure src="./pregnancy-photoshoot-3.jpg" title="Pregnancy photoshoot in Vogue style in Tallinn" >}}

_YES:_ Luxurious dress is ideal for a pregnant photo session a la Vogue. 
It doesn't matter if it isn't completely fastened; we'll figure out a way to hide it.

_NO:_ Summer "floral print" dresses

## Basic dress

{{< figure src="./pregnancy-photoshoot-4.jpg" title="Pregnancy photo shoot in Tallinn" >}}

A standard noodle dress looks wonderful on its own and may also be the basis for an outfit with accessories, shoes, and outerwear.

## Shirt

{{< figure src="./pregnancy-photoshoot-5.jpg" title="Pregnancy photo shoot in studio" >}}

The shirt must be loose! Take one that is either male or female, but a size or two bigger than yours. It will look great draped over a nude body, in underwear, or a bodysuit.

A jacket over a body or over underwear is an alternative to a shirt. 
It should be long and loose. This will give you a contemporary, fashionable, and slimline look.

## Jeans/Pants/Pantsuits

{{< figure src="./pregnancy-photoshoot-7.jpg" title="Pregnancy photoshoot in the style of Vogue in Tallinn" >}}

Jeans and pants can be worn alone or with tops, bodysuits, and outerwear. 
Jeans/trousers may not be fully fastened on the belly, but they must be modern - not too tight, without embroidery, rhinestones, holes, etc.

## Outerwear

{{< figure src="./pregnancy-photoshoot-8.jpg" title="Pregnancy photo shoot in Tallinn" >}}

One benefit of the Vogue style is that we are not limited to the interior and are allowed to use outerwear into our setups. 
Jacket made of leather or denim, a trench, or a fur or raincoat. 
They look great on a nude body and may be worn over clothing like a dress or pants and a top.

## Footwear
The most commonly used:
- black, white, or brightly colored traditional boats with decorations.
- rough shoes.

## What NOT to wear to a photoshoot
- lace peignoirs
- printed summer dresses 
- outfits with vivid colors and very sparkly fabrics
- also do not take booties, baby things, soft toys, bows for the belly 

## Important details
- Clean the soles of your shoes before wearing them during a shot to prevent scuffs on the studio's paper backgrounds. Even if you just stepped out of the car and into the studio wearing your shoes, they won't work for the shooting. Alternately, you'll need to use painters tape to glue the sole.
- Natural colors and French or light pink should be used for the manicure. If we are going to take full-length shots with bare feet or in open shoes, a neutral pedicure is also preferred.
- Iron or steam all clothes.
