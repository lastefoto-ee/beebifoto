Every newborn photographer has a preferred pose in which they lay their tiny models most frequently. 
And I'm no differentâ€”my favorite pose is on the tummy.

Insanely touching, with a touching deflection in the back and legs folded in a "bow", it is ideal for both near and distant shots... Parents frequently decide to print pictures of their baby in this pose.

Even though it seems natural, it is difficult to place the baby in this pose. Interfering factors include hypertonia, colic, and a photographer's lack of expertise. 
But I always succeed.

When the elbow and bent knee contact, it is extremely cool.

However, newborn photography demands the extreme care and tenderness and does not accept fanaticism. As a result, if the baby from my third effort does not fit into pose "per the book," I will not insist and will instead search for a solution that works for both of us. The "on the tummy" pose is very lovely no matter how you look at it.
